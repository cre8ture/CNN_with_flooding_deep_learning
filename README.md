# Faiss: Efficient Vector Search and Similarity Indexing

Welcome to the Faiss project! This repository provides an introduction to Faiss, a powerful library for efficient similarity search and indexing of high-dimensional vectors, such as embeddings derived from text data.

## Overview

Faiss, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), is designed to accelerate similarity search operations in large datasets of high-dimensional vectors. It is widely used for applications involving machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

## How Faiss Works

Faiss provides various indexing techniques optimized for speed and memory efficiency. One key feature is the ability to quantize vectors to compact codes, reducing memory usage during search operations while maintaining high accuracy.

Faiss supports multiple index types, including:

- **Flat Index**: Simple linear scan of vectors.
- **IVF (Inverted File) Index**: Divides vectors into clusters and maintains inverted lists for faster retrieval.
- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) Index**: Builds a navigable graph to speed up searches.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Index**: Projects vectors into a lower-dimensional space for faster indexing.

## Embeddings and Vectorizing Text

Embeddings are numerical representations of data, such as words or sentences in natural language processing. They capture semantic relationships between data points in a continuous vector space. Embeddings can be learned using techniques like Word2Vec, FastText, or transformer-based models like BERT.

Vectorizing text involves converting text data into numerical vectors, often using pretrained embeddings. These vectors enable semantic analysis, similarity calculations, and efficient indexing for search.

## Indexing and Quantization

Indexing involves organizing high-dimensional vectors in a way that enables efficient similarity search. Faiss indexes store vector data in a manner that optimizes memory and accelerates retrieval operations.

Quantization, a key technique in Faiss, involves mapping high-dimensional vectors to a discrete set of compact codes. This reduces memory usage during search, making it feasible to index and search large-scale vector datasets efficiently.
